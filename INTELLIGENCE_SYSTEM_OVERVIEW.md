# Enhanced Intelligence Dashboard System

## What We've Built

### üéØ New Intelligence APIs

#### 1. **User Snapshot API** (`/api/intelligence/user-snapshot`)
**Purpose:** Aggregates ALL user data from every table into one comprehensive snapshot

**Returns:**
- ‚úÖ Profile data (role, experience, location, salary, skills)
- ‚úÖ Career objectives (target role, industry, timeline, goals)
- ‚úÖ Resume analysis (score, strengths, weaknesses, identified skills)
- ‚úÖ Job search activity (viewed, saved, applied, dismissed)
- ‚úÖ Career progress (milestones, weekly stats, momentum, streak)
- ‚úÖ Engagement metrics (activity level, points, last active)
- ‚úÖ Setup completion percentage

**Key Features:**
- Pulls from 8 database tables simultaneously
- Calculates metrics like weekly streak, setup completion
- Identifies skill gaps by comparing resume skills to profile skills
- Shows job application performance

#### 2. **Comprehensive Analysis API** (`/api/intelligence/comprehensive-analysis`)
**Purpose:** Generates AI-powered personalized career intelligence using Claude AI

**Uses:**
- Real user snapshot data
- Career benchmarks from database
- Top in-demand skills from skills_intelligence table

**Generates:**
1. **Market Fit Score** (0-100) - How ready you are for target role
2. **Skill Gap Analysis** - Exact skills to learn with priority and timeline
3. **Salary Insights** - Real market data + your position + potential increase
4. **Career Trajectory** - Most likely next role + timeline + probability
5. **Competitive Analysis** - Your percentile vs peers
6. **Action Plan** - Immediate actions, this week, this month, next 3 months
7. **Market Conditions** - Demand, competition, hiring trends

**Key Innovation:**
- Uses ACTUAL user data, not generic defaults
- Compares to real benchmarks
- Provides specific, actionable recommendations
- Shows exactly what skills to learn and why

#### 3. **Real Salary Data API** (`/api/intelligence/salary-data`)
**Purpose:** Fetches REAL market salary data from Adzuna API

**Features:**
- Queries Adzuna's live job market data
- Returns actual salary ranges (min, median, max, percentiles)
- Adjusts for experience level
- Shows data confidence (high/medium/low)
- Falls back to industry averages if no data
- Supports US, UK, Canada, Australia

**Returns:**
```javascript
{
  role: "Software Engineer",
  location: "United States",
  salary_range: {
    min: 85000,
    median: 125000,
    max: 180000,
    percentile_25: 95000,
    percentile_75: 150000
  },
  data_points: 247, // How many jobs analyzed
